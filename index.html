    <h2>A full-funnel system built to <em>sell flex units</em> to the right buyers.</h2>
    <p>Mountain View Commons has a compelling product, a model unit, and real urgency with Phase 2 pricing before Phase 3 increases hit. What's been missing is a system that gets the right message in front of the right people and closes the loop between a lead and a walk-in. That's what this plan builds.</p>

        <h4>The Model Unit Changes Everything</h4>
        <p>Previous campaigns underperformed because buyers couldn't visualize the product. The model unit — man cave, garage, finished living space — removes that barrier. Every channel we build leads to experiencing it in person.</p>

        <h4>No Conversion Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>Past agencies generated leads but had no system for follow-up. Leads go cold fast without immediate response. We build automated CRM follow-up so every lead gets a touchpoint within 60 seconds.</p>
        <span class="tag">Priority Fix</span>

        <h4>Website Not Built for Paid Traffic</h4>
        <p>The current Squarespace site is a brochure. Paid traffic needs dedicated landing pages built for conversion — specific to each buyer persona with a clear CTA and proper tracking. Multiple domains (mtnviewcommonsut.com, mountainviewcommonshc.com, mtnviewcommons.com) are also diluting search authority and should be consolidated.</p>

        <h4>Google Business Profile Unclaimed</h4>
        <p>The GBP is unclaimed, has zero reviews, no website linked, and an inaccurate description. This is free visibility being left on the table and needs to be fixed before any paid campaigns run.</p>

        <p>RV owners, boat owners, car collectors, and snowmobile enthusiasts within 100 miles of Salt Lake City. They have a concrete, immediate problem — where do their toys go in the off-season? MVC solves it with 18-foot ceilings, 14-foot pull-through garage doors, and usable living and office space above.</p>

        <h4>The Lifestyle / Second Home Buyer</h4>
        <p>Affluent buyers already in Red Ledges, Tuhaye, or the Park City corridor who want a flex space near their second home — for guests, toys, or a mountain office. Minutes from the Heber Valley private airport, 15 minutes to Deer Valley, and adjacent to the new Marcella Club golf course. Nightly rental zoning adds an income offset angle.</p>

    <div class="advisory-note" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <div class="advisory-label">What's included</div>
      <p>Full foundation build (landing pages, CRM, GBP, model unit video production, subcontractor referral program, call tracking, automations), Google Search as primary channel, direct mail, local print and magazine advertising, CPA and professional cold email outreach, and monthly reporting. Everything runs through a single system with proper lead attribution and pipeline visibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advisory-note" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <div class="advisory-label">Our Recommendation</div>
      <p>The foundation gets built first — no paid media runs until it's in place. Once live, Google Search and direct mail launch first, followed by CPA outreach and print placements. The first 60–90 days are about proving the model before we consider scaling budgets up. Print placements are timed to peak buyer seasons. At $500K+ margin per unit, even one additional sale covers the full annual investment.</p>
